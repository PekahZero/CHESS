SELECT The provided SQL query is incomplete, and it seems to be missing the necessary components to fulfill the requirement of showing the property type descriptions of properties belonging to a specific code. Based on the instructions and the provided database schema, I will construct a complete SQL query that adheres to the guidelines.
SELECT ```sql SELECT DISTINCT property_name FROM Properties WHERE property_type_code IN (SELECT property_type_code FROM Ref_Property_Types WHERE property_type_description IN ('house', 'apartment')) AND room_count > 1 ORDER BY property_name DESC
