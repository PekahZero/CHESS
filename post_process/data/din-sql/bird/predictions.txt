If the result is positive, it indicates that more SMEs pay in Czech koruna

SELECT CustomerID FROM transactions_1k WHERE Price = 634.8 AND Date = '2012-08-25'   2. **Get Consumption for 2012**: Once we have the CustomerID, we need to find the consumption for that customer in the year 2012. We will look for records in the yearmonth table where the date starts with '2012'.   The SQL query for this step is:      SELECT Consumption FROM yearmonth WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM transactions_1k WHERE Price = 634.8 AND Date = '2012-08-25') AND Date LIKE '2012%'   3. **Get Consumption for 2013**: Similarly, we need to find the consumption for the same customer in the year 2013.   The SQL query for this step is:      SELECT Consumption FROM yearmonth WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM transactions_1k WHERE Price = 634.8 AND Date = '2012-08-25') AND Date LIKE '2013%'   4. **Calculate the Consumption Decrease Rate**: Finally, we will calculate the consumption decrease rate using the formula:   \[   \text{Consumption Decrease Rate} = \frac{(\text{consumption\_2012} - \text{consumption\_2013})}{\text{consumption\_2012}}   \]   To combine all these steps into a single SQL query, we can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subqueries to get the consumption values for both years and then calculate the decrease rate.The final SQL query that combines all these steps is:WITH consumption_data AS (    SELECT         (SELECT SUM(Consumption) FROM yearmonth WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM transactions_1k WHERE Price = 634.8 AND Date = '2012-08-25') AND Date LIKE '2012%') AS consumption_2012,        (SELECT SUM(Consumption) FROM yearmonth WHERE CustomerID = (SELECT CustomerID FROM transactions_1k WHERE Price = 634.8 AND Date = '2012-08-25') AND Date LIKE '2013%') AS consumption_2013)SELECT     (consumption_2012 - consumption_2013) / consumption_2012 AS consumption_decrease_rateFROM consumption_dataWHERE consumption_2012 IS NOT NULL
