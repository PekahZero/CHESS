SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C INNER JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid INNER JOIN sets AS S ON L.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' However, since the `sets` table does not have a direct relationship with the `cards` table through `uuid`, the correct approach would be to find the set code from the `cards` table if it exists, or to adjust the query based on the actual schema relationships. The final corrected SQL query is:SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C INNER JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid INNER JOIN sets AS S ON L.uuid = S.uuid WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' This query assumes that the `cards` table has a `uuid` that can be used to join with the `legalities` table, and then the `uuid` from `legalities` can be used to join with the `sets` table.

SELECT PostHistoryTypeId FROM postHistory WHERE PostId = 3720;SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserId) FROM comments WHERE PostId = 3720;However, if we want to combine the results into a single output, we can use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery.
