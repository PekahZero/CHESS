SELECT specobjid FROM specobj WHERE class = 'galactic-stars' AND subclass IS NOT NULL
SELECT equivalent_width FROM specobj WHERE class = 'galactic-stars'If there is no such column, then the query cannot be corrected without additional information about where to find the equivalent width estimates. If the column does not exist, the query would need to be revised based on the actual schema.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM specobj JOIN galspecline ON galspecline.specobjid = specobj.specobjid WHERE specobj.class = 'galactic-stars'
SELECT *FROM specobj AS sINNER JOIN galspecline AS g ON s.specobjid = g.specobjidINNER JOIN spplines AS sp ON s.specobjid = sp.specobjid This query now correctly retrieves all information about spectroscopic objects and their associated emission line estimates from both the `galspecline` and `spplines` tables.
