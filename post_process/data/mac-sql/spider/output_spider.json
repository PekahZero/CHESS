In that case, you would adjust the query accordingly. \n\nIf we assume Anguilla is part of the United Kingdom, the query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT continent FROM country WHERE Name = 'United Kingdom';\n```\n\nThis will return the continent for the United Kingdom, which is Europe.", "fixed": false, "try_times": 1, "pred": "SELECT continent FROM country WHERE Name = 'United Kingdom';"}

The `Friend` table contains the relationships between students and their friends.\n\nSince the grades in the `Highschooler` table are represented as integers (e.g., 12, 11, 10, 9), we need to filter for students with grades greater than 5. However, since the maximum grade in the provided examples is 12, all students in the dataset will meet the grade condition.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of friends each student has from the `Friend` table and filter for those who have 2 or more friends.\n\nHere is the SQL query that accomplishes this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT H.name \nFROM Highschooler AS H \nJOIN Friend AS F ON H.ID = F.student_id \nGROUP BY H.ID \nHAVING COUNT(F.friend_id) >= 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We select the `name` from the `Highschooler` table (aliased as `H`).\n- We join the `Friend` table (aliased as `F`) on the condition that the `ID` from `Highschooler` matches the `student_id` in `Friend`.\n- We group the results by the `ID` of the high schoolers to aggregate the friend counts.\n- We use the `HAVING` clause to filter for those students who have 2 or more friends.\n\nThis query will return the names of high schoolers who meet the specified criteria.", "fixed": false, "try_times": 1, "pred": "SELECT H.name \nFROM Highschooler AS H \nJOIN Friend AS F ON H.ID = F.student_id \nGROUP BY H.ID \nHAVING COUNT(F.friend_id) >= 2"}
